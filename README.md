# Project #: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Aarik Guy, Marc Mangini
* Class: CS354 Section #001
* Semester: Fall 2024

## Overview

In this project we implemented two classes that model an instance of a nondeterministic
finite automaton and its behavior. 

## Reflection

This project wasn't that bad. I feel like I had to remake eClosure 
like 3 or 4 times before I finally got it right. I would try to run unit
tests checking for eClosure and I kept getting unexpected results so I took a step
back from eClosure for a little while and worked on everything else and then
I went back to eClosure and saved it for last essentially. Then finally I got
eClosure to work, which was nice.

Other than that the project wasn't too bad. I appreciate the amount of time
we're given for these projects. I always like to start projects sooner rather
than later. 

## Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?

First you're going to want to clone the repositorty to your local machine by putting in the command:

git clone https://github.com/marcmangini/CS361_P2.git

Then you're going to want to head over to the unit tests and hit the green play button at the top.
Or if you have VSCode then you can use the 'Testing' extension that plays all the unit tests.

## Results

All of the unit tests pass, including the ones that were added later.

## Sources used

I mainly used the slides from class, but I did refer to these to look at some of the methods of a Set and HashTable.
